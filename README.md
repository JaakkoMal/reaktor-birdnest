# Dronebuster application

The application can be found running at https://dronebuster.fly.dev/

## About the project

This is my take on Reaktor's summer trainee 2023 pre-assignment. The full description of the task can be found at https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/.

In my application the information of all the drones inside the detection area is shown for 10 minutes since the last sighting of an individual drone. The information for each detected drone is presented in a form of a card. For the drones violating the No Drone Zone the contact information of the drone's owner is retreived and shown. Users of the application can also view the real-time situation inside the detection area on a radar screen by clicking the "show radar" button above the drone cards.
